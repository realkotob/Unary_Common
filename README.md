![Common architecture](/Info/Architecture.png)
## Multiplayer oriented modding framework with Steam Workshop integration built on top of Godot engine

Unary.Common provides you with a toolset to make plug-n-play architecture for your
Core game, as well as for all the Mods, which allows you to have interchangable mods in-between
sessions/servers/lobbies with automatic Steam workshop / Mods folder synchronization. Is uses the
same ClassDB-like architecture from Godot, and provides an easy way to separate codebase into 
Shared, Client and Server systems.
